# Blog-Website-using-React
This project is a React-based Blog Website developed as part of a hands-on assignment to practice core React concepts. The application includes a blog creation form, a main blog listing page with content previews, and a detailed view for each post. Navigation is handled using React Router, and blog data is managed using React state with persistence through localStorage. The UI is responsive and user-friendly, with optional features like edit, delete, and search functionality implemented for enhanced usability.
